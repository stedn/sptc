# Amtrak Adventure: Exploring the Western US by Train

Claire and I embarked on our Amtrak adventure across the western United States, armed with an irresistible deal on an Amtrak 10-ride pass that promised both economy and exploration. Our journey kicked off at Chicago Union Station, a historic gem dating back to 1925, bustling with commuters and travelers alike.

## California Zephyr and Historic Railways

The California Zephyr awaited us—a train steeped in history, inaugurated in 1949 to showcase luxurious travel from Chicago to Oakland. As we boarded, the allure of its dome cars and scenic Rocky Mountain vistas beckoned, promising a journey rich in both natural beauty and historical significance.

## Glenwood Springs, CO: Hot Springs and Skiing

In Glenwood Springs, Colorado, our journey took an unexpected turn. Known for its healing hot springs and mountainous terrain, Glenwood Springs offered us a unique winter experience. The crisp air contrasted with the warmth of the springs, providing a perfect blend of relaxation and adventure. With ski gear rented easily in town, we seized the opportunity to hit the slopes, carving through fresh powder against a backdrop of snow-capped peaks.

## Blizzard Near Lake Tahoe and Theodore Roosevelt

Our plans to continue westward were momentarily halted by a blizzard near Lake Tahoe, halting the California Zephyr in its tracks. Undeterred, we embraced the extended stay, indulging in additional visits to the hot springs and immersing ourselves in the town’s rich history, including Theodore Roosevelt’s legendary visit in 1905.

## Resuming the Journey

Resuming our journey was a whirlwind of rescheduled tickets and hurried boarding, the urgency palpable as we chased the departing train. San Francisco greeted us warmly, a reunion with family before we turned northward to Portland on the Empire Builder.

## Empire Builder and Unexpected Delays

Named for the pioneering spirit of the Great Northern Railway, the Empire Builder proved eventful with delays and unexpected mechanical issues in Seattle. Despite setbacks, the journey through Glacier National Park’s rugged peaks and icy lakes left an indelible mark, igniting a desire to return for further exploration.

## Reflections on Train Travel

Our Amtrak adventure wasn’t just about getting from A to B. It prompted us to slow down, appreciate the landscapes, and connect with fellow travelers. Amtrak’s sustainable ethos and the joy of riding through the American West reshaped our travel philosophy, inspiring us to embrace the journey as much as the destination.

## Conclusion

Our journey across the American West by train was an unforgettable blend of history, natural beauty, and unexpected moments. From historic railways and hot springs to blizzards and delays, Amtrak delivered an experience that transcended mere transportation—a reminder of the beauty found in the journey itself.
