# Exploring Washington DC by Amtrak: A Solarpunk Travel Adventure

I recently had the opportunity to join a friend on a journey to Washington DC using Amtrak, and it turned into quite the adventure with Solarpunk Travel's concierge Amtrak buddy system! Here's a glimpse into our experience and discoveries along the way.

## Journey with Amtrak

When my friend mentioned traveling to DC for a work conference via train, I couldn't resist tagging along to share my insights and love for train travel. Amtrak has always been my preferred mode of transportation for its scenic routes and relaxed atmosphere.

The journey was delightful, especially as we followed part of the historic C&O Canal route. I made use of the convenient @capitalbikeshare bike rental service to explore the canal further, discovering hidden gems along the way. What amazed me was the seamless integration between bike share services and Google Maps, which made it effortless to locate bike stations and plan our exploration around DC.

## Cultural Highlights in DC

During our stay in DC, we made sure to visit the @nmaahc's captivating afrofuturism exhibit—an enriching experience that delved into future possibilities through the lens of African American culture and history.

Our timing in DC was serendipitous as well. We found ourselves amidst a massive demonstration outside the White House, where passionate voices raised in support of a ceasefire echoed through the streets—an unforgettable moment of civic engagement.

## Amtrak Adventures: Ups and Downs

Amtrak proved reliable on our journey to DC, arriving just under an hour late, which in Amtrak terms is practically on time. However, our return trip adhered more closely to the classic experience of winter travel by train in the US—several hours delayed. Despite the delay, the journey remained comfortable, allowing us to appreciate the snowy landscapes passing by outside our windows.

## Reflections on Train Travel

Traveling by Amtrak isn't just about getting from point A to B; it's about the journey itself. From scenic routes and cultural discoveries to unexpected delays and community moments, every trip with Amtrak is a reminder of the joys and challenges of sustainable travel.

## Conclusion

Our DC adventure with Amtrak and Solarpunk Travel was a testament to the beauty of train travel and the rich experiences it offers. Whether you're exploring museums, participating in demonstrations, or simply enjoying the ride, Amtrak provides a unique perspective on travel in the US.
