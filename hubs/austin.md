    <p>The Austin Hub occupies the ancestral, traditional and contemporary lands of the Jumanos, Coahuiltecan, Nʉmʉnʉʉ Sookobitʉ (Comanche), Ndé Kónitsąąíí Gokíyaa (Lipan Apache), and Tonkawa.  We enjoy today what the indigenous people protected and continue to protect, and we remember to be grateful.</p>
