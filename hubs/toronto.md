    <p>The Toronto Hub occupies the ancestral, traditional and contemporary lands of the Anishinabewaki ᐊᓂᔑᓈᐯᐗᑭ, Wendake-Nionwentsïo, Ho-de-no-sau-nee-ga (Haudenosaunee), Mississauga, and Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation.  We enjoy today what the indigenous people protected and continue to protect, and we remember to be grateful.</p>
