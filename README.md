# SOLARPUNK TRAVEL COOPERATIVE (SPTC)

This is the jekyll code for the [solarpunk travel cooperative](https://solarpunktravel.org).

# Google Sheet backend.

The database that is hosting all the content for this site is actually just cells in a Google Sheets spreadsheet.  To learn more about how that works check out [stedn's blog](https://bonkerfield.org/2022/02/google-sheet-hosted-website/).

### Credits

The Jekyll template code for the website has mutated from this [Forty Jekyll Theme](https://gitlab.com/andrewbanchich/forty-jekyll-theme).
